I just played the example code already given through the read me. Following the code was extrememly difficult and better variable names would have helped alot. The examples were fairly easy to understand and didn't take too much to understand which was nice.

##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####

I would say avoid implementation details but make sure to include every function including parameters and what the method returns. Really really avoid implementation details!!!

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Answer goes here!

I could not get jsdoc work and forking messed up my code and the require would get messed up because of where it was located. JSdoc was the biggest problem. I also had serious issues reading the code. I think it is something to to teach before getting graded on it because I found that to be stressful.
